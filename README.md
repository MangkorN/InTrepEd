Our product will guide students through a digital visual learning experience in a
simulated world. The focus is on building basic skill sets for self-development and for the
budding teen entrepreneur. The first of 12 modules is entitled "Artistâ€™s Eye". It is designed 
to provide the teen / student with an immersive, interactive visual experience that will challenge, 
sharpen and evaluate observation skills from varying perspectives.
